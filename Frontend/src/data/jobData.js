I go through life with one face that doesn't move. I never smile, cry, laugh, frown. I'm a hollow vessel and my thoughts are empty.\n\nYeah.\n\nMy friend tells me I should seek adventure. I tell my friend that there is nothing adventurous to seek. I work in the mail department. I do the mail. Meet all kinds of personalities and I'm immune to the happy people, stressed people and idiot people.\n\nAn invisible shield has enveloped my being and my eyes are clogged with fog. Nothing reaches me and I reach nothing.\n\nExistence is only breathing…silently.",

Well, I got news for ya. You ARE a success. You ARE special. You ARE a genius. I see it everyday. I see you create these wonderful worlds that just happen. I see these little miracles everyday. I see the magic in you.\n\nYou walk around with this attitude of not caring as much and I love that about you but you don't need to always be this tough street guy who wears his leather jackets and has a chip on his shoulder. You also have that sensitive side that you try to hide but it's always there in your eyes. I know you've been through so much but that's what makes you such an inspiration. It's amazing that you are where you are with everything that happened in your life. If you gave it up, you'd be miserable and you know it!\n\nYou can't stop now. You need to keep on going forward.

It's like I'm there but in a non-existent in a way.
